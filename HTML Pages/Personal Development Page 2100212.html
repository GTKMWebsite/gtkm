<center><p>Here, I will be giving my own summary of chapters 4-7 of the novel called “Twelve Pillars” and then I will be reflecting on how reading it contributed to my personal development.</p>

<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>
<h2>Chapter 4:</h2>
<details>
<summary>Click to see more about this chapter</summary>
<p>Michael and Charlie arranged a meeting at Mack’s Diner where they ordered food and struck up a conversation about how their lives had been going since they hadn’t seen each other for about 4 weeks. Charlie asked Michael about Amy and he described their relationship by saying it was like him “planting or maintaining a garden” meaning it was working because he was putting more time and effort into it. Charlie advised him to keep watering it and giving it sun to prevent the relationship from wilting (getting worse). He then started inquiring about Michael’s career goals. Michael opened up to Charlie by telling him that he had no goals and wanted to go further along in his career. Charlie started giving Michael advice by using things he heard Mr. Davis say. This included:</p>
<p><mark>“Write your goal down”</mark></p>
<p><mark>“The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it”</mark></p>
<p><mark>“Make a million dollars, not for the million dollars, but for what you will have to become to make a million dollars”</mark></p>
<p><mark>“You cannot change your destination overnight, but you can change your direction overnight”</mark></p>
<p>All of which Charlie explained to Michael within the chapter.</p>
</details>

<br>
<h2>Chapter 5:</h2>
<details>
<summary>Click to see more about this chapter</summary>
<p>They both continued their conversation at the diner. Michael was unsure about how he would be able to set a goal while he is swamped by other responsibilities in his life. Charlie then makes reference to another quote by Mr. Davis which says:</p>
<p><mark>“We must all suffer from one of two pains: The pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons”.</mark></p>
<p>He explains that it means if you don’t achieve certain goals in your lifetime, then you will have regrets. He goes on to encourage Michael to make use of his time left on earth because the “days are expensive” and should be spent in the best way possible. Unfortunately, when asked, Michael said he was not already doing that. Charlie warns Michael of the many dangers that are involved with him not managing the time he has left on earth well.</p>
<p>Michael’s pager went off and he had to leave the meeting due to “work stuff” but promised to see Charlie again soon.</p>
</details>

<br>
<h2>Chapter 6:</h2>
<details>
<summary>Click to see more about this chapter</summary>
<p>After 3 weeks, Michael came back to share his new accomplishments with Charlie because his advice and reference to Mr. Davis’ pillars of success worked. Michael’s relationship with Amy had improved and he finally got the time to finish writing his 100 goals. Michael was eager to learn more about the pillars of success and Charlie was willing to teach. Charlie first taught Michael about what Mr. Davis meant when he said:</p>
<p><mark>“Surround yourself with the best”.</mark></p>
<p>This meant that Michael needed to surround himself with the best people and look at how whoever he is around affects him as a person. Charlie went on to do an examination of Michaels’ friends and found himself unimpressed and suggesting that he make adjustments to them. Michael was hesitant and unsure about doing this but after reflecting on a series of questions asked by Charlie, he then came to the realization that they indeed had an effect on him which he never thought of before. Charlie also taught Michael about Mr. Davis’s principle which states:</p>
<p><mark>“Every relationship you have is an association, and each association has either a positive, neutral or negative effect on you. So a person who wants to achieve success has to constantly make a determination about what kind of relationship it is and how to approach that relationship”.</mark></p>
<p>Charlie wouldn’t tell Michael what decision to make but told him that he would either have to stop or limit being affiliated with his friends. Charlie assumed that Michael found this decision difficult because it was easier to stay friends with them than to make new ones. He encouraged Michael to find new “successful” people to build relationships with and mentioned another quote by Mr. Davis which states:</p>
<p><mark>“To attract attractive people you must be attractive. To attract powerful people, you must be powerful. To attract committed people, you must be committed. Instead of going to work on them, go to work on yourself. If you become, you can attract”.</mark></p>
<p>He also shared this quote about attitude:</p>
<p><mark>“Attitude is greatly shaped by influence and association”.</mark></p>
<p>Charlie explained both quotes further and mentioned that maybe the outcome of Michaels’ life would change if he adjusted his associations.</p>
</details>

<br>
<h2>Chapter 7:</h2>
<details>
<summary>Click to see more about this chapter</summary>
<p>Charlie taught Michael of Mr. Davis’ next pillar of success which states:</p>
<p><mark>“A successful person is a life-long learner”.</mark></p>
<p>He emphasized to Michael that going to college alone won’t necessarily make him successful in life and stated that Mr. Davis said:</p>
<p><mark>“Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune”.</mark></p>
<p>Charlie encouraged self-education to Michael because he didn’t believe formal education should be the “end all”. He wanted Michael to continue learning and growing in order to be a successful person. He stated 3 different ways in which Michael could learn on his own. Reading books was one of the ways which Charlie suggested but Michael was not interested/enthusiastic about books. Charlie really wanted him to read it and so he had to resort to a harsh measure by barring Michael from meeting with him again if he did not read a book from his workshop.</p>
<p>After finally agreeing to give one of the books a try, Charlie gave Michael a free copy of a book called "<i>The Magic of Thinking Big</i>". Michael promised to read the book because he wanted to learn more about the pillars of success.</p>

<h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
<p>This novel was truly inspiring and has contributed to my personal development in two ways. Firstly, I realize that I am in the same boat as Michael when it relates to not having the time to/simply not setting goals. I now realize that there is power in the pen and that writing down goals will contribute to me actually accomplishing them. This lesson is one that I will be exercising in my life since I sometimes feel a bit stuck. Secondly, I learned that learning doesn’t stop at just formal education and if continued can lead to great success. As a young individual, I crave success in my life and so this novel has motivated me to continue learning.</p>
